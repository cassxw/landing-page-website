# Landing Page Website
A personal project for a landing page website, as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

This Git repository serves as the foundation for my personal project, a Landing Page Website, which I am developing as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to create an engaging and visually appealing landing page that effectively showcases a specific product, service, or concept.
